				<br/><strong>A</strong> planet is a large, rounded astronomical body that is neither a star nor its remnant.<br/> The best available theory of planet formation is the nebular hypothesis,<br/> which posits that an interstellar cloud collapses out of a nebula to create a young protostar orbited by a protoplanetary disk.<br/> Planets grow in this disk by the gradual accumulation of material driven by gravity,<br/> a process called accretion. The Solar System has at least eight planets:<br/> the terrestrial planets Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, and the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.<br/> These planets each rotate around an axis tilted with respect to its orbital pole.<br/> All planets of the Solar System other than Mercury possess a considerable atmosphere,<br/> and some share such features as ice caps, seasons, volcanism, hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.<br/> Apart from Venus and Mars, the Solar System planets generate magnetic fields,<br/> and all except Venus and Mercury have natural satellites.<br/> The giant planets bear planetary rings, the most prominent being those of Saturn.<br/>

				The word planet probably comes from the Greek <strong>planḗtai</strong>, meaning "wanderers".<br/> In antiquity, this word referred to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun" target="_blank">Sun</a>,<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon" target="_blank"> Moon</a>, and five points of light visible by the naked eye that moved across the background of the stars—namely,<br/> Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn. Planets have historically had religious associations:<br/> multiple cultures identified celestial bodies with gods, and these connections with mythology<br/> and folklore persist in the schemes for naming newly discovered Solar System bodies.<br/> Earth itself was recognized as a planet when heliocentrism supplanted geocentrism during the 16th and 17th centuries.<br/>

				With the development of the telescope, the meaning of planet broadened to include objects only visible with assistance:<br/> the ice giants Uranus and Neptune; Ceres and other bodies later recognized to be part of the asteroid belt;<br/> and Pluto, later found to be the largest member of the collection of icy bodies known as the Kuiper belt.<br/> The discovery of other large objects in the Kuiper belt, particularly Eris, spurred debate about how exactly to define a planet.<br/> The International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted a standard by which the four terrestrials and four giants qualify,<br/> placing Ceres, Pluto and Eris in the category of dwarf planet,[1][2][3] although many planetary scientists have continued<br/> to apply the term planet more broadly.[4]

				Further advances in astronomy led to the discovery of over five thousand planets outside the Solar System,<br/> termed exoplanets. These include hot Jupiters—giant planets that orbit close to their parent stars—like 51 Pegasi b,<br/> super-Earths like Gliese 581c that have masses in between that of Earth and Neptune; and planets smaller than Earth,<br/> like Kepler-20e. Multiple exoplanets have been found to orbit in the habitable zones of their stars,<br/> but Earth remains the only planet known to support life.
